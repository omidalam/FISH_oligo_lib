## Introduction

DNA Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a technique to visualize stretches of chromatin in fixed cells the technique has been originally developed in the early 80s [@Langer-Safer] and extensively optimized by Cremer lab.[@Solovei2002; @Solovei2010 ;@Markaki] This protocol describes the combination of EdU labeling (as a marker for cell cycle) and 3D DNA-FISH in HCT116 cells, but with optimization can be used for all adherent cells.
