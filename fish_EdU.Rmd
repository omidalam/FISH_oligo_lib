# Introduction

DNA Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a technique to visualize stretches of chromatin in fixed cells the
technique has been originally developed in the early 80s [@Langer-Safer] and extensively optimized by Cremer lab.[@Solovei2002; @Solovei2010 ;@Markaki] 
This protocol describes the combination of EdU labeling (as a marker for cell cycle stage) and 3D DNA-FISH in HCT116 cells, but with optimization can be used for all adherent cells.

# Materials and equipments
All buffers should be filtered before use to reduce the noise from floating particles.
This is specially important for the buffers containing 

+ DIG and/or biotin labelled probes

# Procedure
##
### Cell Seeding
Cells seeded at 0.6e6/ml, 0.5 ml culture media well.

### EdU Pulse
EdU pusled (A:C)*(1:4) by replacing with the media containing EdU( 5mM).
6.5µl 10mM EdU in 13 ml media.
Pulsed for 10 minutes.

### Cell Fixation

(@) Rinse cells 3 times, with warm(37&deg;C).
(@) Transfer coverslips to a new 24 well plate containing warm PBS. 
    + This is to leave behind all the debris from the cells attached to plate.
(@) Fix with 3% PFA in 1X PBS for 10 min at RT.
    + After this step you either need to gradually exchange PFA with PBS, or quench it with PBS-Glycine really quick.
(@) Quench with 0.5M Glycine-PBS for 5 min at RT.
(@) Permeabilize with 0.5% Tx-10 in PBS. 10 min at RT.
(@) Rinse the cells with PBS, 3 times.
