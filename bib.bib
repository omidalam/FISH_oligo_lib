abstract = {Fluorescence in situ hybridization on three-dimensionally preserved cells (3D-FISH) is an efficient tool to analyze the subcellular localization and spatial arrangement of targeted DNA sequences and RNA transcripts at the single cell level. 3D reconstructions from serial optical sections obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) have long been considered the gold standard for 3D-FISH analyses. Recent super-resolution techniques circumvent the diffraction-limit of optical resolution and have defined a new state-of-the-art in bioimaging. Three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) represents one of these technologies. Notably, 3D-SIM renders an eightfold improved volumetric resolution over conventional imaging, and allows the simultaneous visualization of differently labeled target structures. These features make this approach highly attractive for the analysis of spatial relations and substructures of nuclear targets that escape detection by conventional light microscopy. Here, we focus on the application of 3D-SIM for the visualization of subnuclear 3D-FISH preparations. In comparison with conventional fluorescence microscopy, the quality of 3D-SIM data is dependent to a much greater extent on the optimal sample preparation, labeling and acquisition conditions. We describe typical problems encountered with super-resolution imaging of in situ hybridizations in mammalian tissue culture cells and provide optimized DNA-/(RNA)-FISH protocols including combinations with immunofluorescence staining (Immuno-FISH) and DNA replication labeling using click chemistry.},

abstract = {A method is described for localizing DNA sequences hybridized in situ to Drosophila polytene chromosomes. This procedure utilizes a biotin-labeled analog of TTP that can be incorporated enzymatically into DNA probes by nick-translation. After hybridization in situ, the biotin molecules in the probe serve as antigens which bind affinity-purified rabbit antibiotin antibodies. The site of hybridization is then detected either fluorimetrically, by using fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, or cytochemically, by using an anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. When combined with Giemsa staining, the immunoperoxidase detection method provides a permanent record that is suitable for detailed cytogenetic analysis. This immunological approach offers four advantages over conventional autoradiographic procedures for detecting in situ hybrids: (i) the time required to determine the site of hybridization is decreased markedly, (ii) biotin-labeled probes are chemically stable and give reproducible results for many months; (iii) biotin-labeled probes appear to produce less background noise than do radiolabeled probes; and (iv) the resolving power is equal to and often greater than that achieved autoradiographically.},

@article{Solovei2002,
abstract = {3D-FISH has become a major tool for studying the higher order chromatin organization in the cell nucleus. It is not clear, however, to what extent chromatin arrangement in the nucleus after fixation and 3D-FISH still reflects the order in living cells. To study this question, we compared higher order chromatin arrangements in living cells with those found after the 3D-FISH procedure. For in vivo studies we employed replication labeling of DNA with Cy3-conjugated nucleotides and/or chromatin labeling by GFP-tagged histone 2B. At the light microscope level, we compared the intranuclear distribution of H2B-GFP-tagged chromatin and the positions of replication-labeled chromatin domains in the same individual cells in vivo, after fixation with 4{\%} paraformaldehyde, and after 3D-FISH. Light microscope data demonstrate a high degree of preservation of the spatial arrangement of ∼1-Mb chromatin domains. Subsequent electron microscope investigations of chromatin structure showed strong alterations in the ultrastructure of the nucleus caused mainly by the heat denaturation step. Through this step chromatin acquires the appearance of a net with mesh size of 50-200 nm roughly corresponding to the average displacement of the chromatin domains observed at light microscope level. We conclude that 3D-FISH is a useful tool to study chromosome territory structure and arrangements down to the level of ∼1-Mb chromatin domain positions. However, important ultrastructural details of the chromatin architecture are destroyed by the heat denaturation step, thus putting a limit to the usefulness of 3D-FISH analyses at nanometer scales. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},
